                I have been working with computers since about 1986. I started
                off as a data analyst using Foxpro for DOS and MS Excel to
                generate data analysis reports for a direct mailing company in
                Bellevue, WA.
              </li>
              <li>
                From there, I took a position working with Foxpro for DOS and a
                suite of software to prepare client data for mailing called
                PostalSoft in Kent, WA.
              </li>
              <li>
                I was hired on to continue to work with client data in the
                direct mail industry. My next job dealt with Xerox printers with
                with large reels holding data. I also learned a MS Word 3rd
                party app to design print and merge data for printing on the
                Xerox machines.
              </li>
              <li>
                I then took a position where we moved to MS Foxpro for Windows
                and upgraded versions of the PostalSoft program. I also took a
                lead position in the printing department and they had a version
                of software to create and merge documents into a printable form
                for Xerox printers.
              </li>
              <li>
                I had a couple of jobs doing the above work before I landed my
                first "programming" job. I was attending college and met someone
                that introduced me to a manufacturing company. I worked with MS
                Access and eventually turned the small app into an intregal part
                of their manufacturing line in Auburn, WA.
              </li>
              <li>
                I then landed another job in the direct mail industry where i
                worked with VB6 and MS SQL to custom design programs that would
                create beautiful pdf documents to generate printed statements
                for banks and credit unions among other clientele in Renton, WA.
              </li>
              <li>
                I then moved and took up a job at a bank and learned some IT
                skills and began to work with the MS Teams and Office 365
                environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Currently, I am working as a copier technician and have learned
                a number of skills in the area of network communication.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the side, I am learning to create website as you see here.
